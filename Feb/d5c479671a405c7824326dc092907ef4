The Financial Advisory and Intermediary Services (FAIS) Ombud, advocate Nonku Tshombe, has issued a warning reminding consumers to exercise caution when investing in cryptocurrency. Since the Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA) announced its regulation of cryptocurrency, the ombud has seen a slight increase in related complaints. The warning follows a recent move by the South African Advertising Regulatory Board to add a new clause to its Code of Advertising Practice dealing with cryptocurrency products. In a nutshell, companies advertising crypto-assets have to be explicit in terms of warning consumers that these are high-risk products and that you can risk losing your capital. Investors worldwide lost money when cryptocurrency exchange FTX collapsed in November last year. Founder Sam Bankman-Fried is on trial for what is being called one of the largest fraud cases in US history. Tshombe says some of the key aspects to look out for when looking to invest in cryptocurrency-related investments include: “Cryptocurrency assets are becoming a new asset class and an alternative to the more traditional asset classes such as equities, bonds, property, cash etc. The consensus however is that it can be regarded as a risky investment with high volatility. “One should only consider an investment into cryptocurrency if you have a high-risk tolerance, and you are in a strong financial position where you can afford to lose any money invested. “An investment into cryptocurrency should only form part of a diversified portfolio, and then only after you have received advice from a registered financial services provider as to whether an investment into cryptocurrency is appropriate in view of your financial needs and circumstances,” she says.
