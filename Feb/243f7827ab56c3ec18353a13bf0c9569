With our proven competencies handling art from southern Africa, Asia, Europe and North America, I have no doubt that this new sale will broaden dialogue among artists and collectors from across the African continent and beyond, as well as provide networking opportunities for art professionals.” To coincide with the launch exhibition for Curatorial Voices, Strauss & Co also announce its sponsorship and support of the inaugural Art Business Conference, the first event of its kind on the continent, with a presence in other major international art centres of London, New York, and Shanghai.

Celebrating Esias Bosch (1923 – 2012) centenary, Strauss & Co is proud to present a single-artist, timed online auction of his work between 13 and 20 February 2023. The sale, consisting predominantly of works from two major collectors of his work, includes some of Bosch’s very early earthenware, his favourite medium, stoneware, as well as his popular porcelain ware, and very special small- and large-scale decorative lustreware ceramic tiles. Bosch’s initial training as a fine artist at the University of the Witwatersrand is clearly evident in the painterly quality of these tiles and some critics even refer to him in this regard as South Africa’s ‘Claude Monet’ of ceramics. More than fifty of Bosch’s ceramic works are on display at the Strauss & Co offices located at 89 Central Street, Houghton.  Curator and Senior Art Specialist Wilhelm Van Rensburg interviewed Bosch’s son, Anton, an accomplished ceramic artist in his own right  The 2023 Strauss & Co Fine Wine Rhône-themed timed online auction is one of our finest line-ups yet, featuring iconic producers from France, South Africa and the New World and will run from Monday, 13th – Monday, 20th February. <img data-lazy-fallback="1" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1559182 size-full" src="https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/EED4EE65-1D05-4D7C-AC62-78E55C51D130.jpeg" alt="" width="2400" height="1887" srcset="https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/EED4EE65-1D05-4D7C-AC62-78E55C51D130.jpeg 2400w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/EED4EE65-1D05-4D7C-AC62-78E55C51D130.jpeg?resize=480,377 480w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/EED4EE65-1D05-4D7C-AC62-78E55C51D130.jpeg?resize=768,604 768w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/EED4EE65-1D05-4D7C-AC62-78E55C51D130.jpeg?resize=720,566 720w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/EED4EE65-1D05-4D7C-AC62-78E55C51D130.jpeg?resize=1536,1208 1536w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/EED4EE65-1D05-4D7C-AC62-78E55C51D130.jpeg?resize=2048,1610 2048w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/EED4EE65-1D05-4D7C-AC62-78E55C51D130.jpeg?resize=1280,1006 1280w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/EED4EE65-1D05-4D7C-AC62-78E55C51D130.jpeg?resize=1600,1258 1600w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/EED4EE65-1D05-4D7C-AC62-78E55C51D130.jpeg?resize=350,275 350w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px"  /> And finally, Strauss & Co is pleased to announce its collaboration with the South African National Association for the Visual Arts (SANAVA), the oldest visual arts association in the country, on the Cité Studios Benefit Auction (Monday 13 February – Tuesday 21 February 2023).
