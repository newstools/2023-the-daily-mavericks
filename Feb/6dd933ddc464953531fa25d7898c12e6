A smartphone with a stunning design, staggering camera system, unbelievable performance, overall visionary features and a seamless user experience.  The HUAWEI Mate50 Pro is a smartphone that truly lives up to the legacy of HUAWEI Mate smartphones. There is nothing worse than shattering the screen of your phone. A smartphone is an essential device for many which users take everywhere, even for sports, knocking it into something is quite probable, hence, a durable screen is extremely vital.

In addition to the iconic symmetry and Space Ring Design, the HUAWEI Mate50 Pro also makes use of the elegant Clous de Paris step-patterned embossing design for the first time ever, showcasing a new kind of ordered beauty that’s crafted down to the last detail. The new Ultra Aperture XMAGE Camera boasts the first-ever 10-scale adjustable physical aperture and the most versatile photography capabilities ever seen on a Mate smartphone. <img data-lazy-fallback="1" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1545697 size-full" src="https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/HUAWEI-Mate50-Pro-Front.png" alt="" width="1080" height="1080" srcset="https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/HUAWEI-Mate50-Pro-Front.png 1080w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/HUAWEI-Mate50-Pro-Front.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/HUAWEI-Mate50-Pro-Front.png?resize=480,480 480w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/HUAWEI-Mate50-Pro-Front.png?resize=768,768 768w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/HUAWEI-Mate50-Pro-Front.png?resize=720,720 720w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/HUAWEI-Mate50-Pro-Front.png?resize=100,100 100w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/HUAWEI-Mate50-Pro-Front.png?resize=250,250 250w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/HUAWEI-Mate50-Pro-Front.png?resize=350,350 350w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px"  /> In terms of battery and charging speed, the HUAWEI Mate50 Pro features a 4700 mAh battery within its slim body.
