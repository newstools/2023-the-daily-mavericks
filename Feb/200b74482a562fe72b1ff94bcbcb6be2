The two activists glued themselves to the carpet after the arrival of film stars at the Berlinale Palast for the festival’s opening ceremony, featuring a video address by Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky and the premier of She Came To Me, directed by US film maker Rebecca Miller. The Last Generation group, which was behind the protest, said the current government and society are the last ones left with a chance of preventing the course to a climate hell with billions of deaths. “Advertising for sustainability on a small scale, like the Berlinale does, is important, but it will not save us on its own. We need to turn things around now,” Raphael Voellmy, one of the activists, said in a statement. “If we continue escaping from reality, we will tear the first climate tipping points and unleash a deadly avalanche from which there is no escape,” said Lisa Winkelmann, the other activist. A Reuters witness said the protest did not interrupt the festival’s opening ceremony. Berlin Film Festival was not immediately available to comment on the incident.
