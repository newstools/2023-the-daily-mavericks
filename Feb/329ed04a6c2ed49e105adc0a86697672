With Formula E visiting Cape Town, the city is charging up to host one of the biggest motorsport events of the year in South Africa. The 2.94km circuit goes around the Cape Town Stadium, with the paddock, pit lane and fan village in Green Point. The cars line up on Vlei Road and, come lights-out, turn left on to Helen Suzman Boulevard, then left again to loop past the V&A Waterfront, the Oranjezicht City Farm Market, Granger Bay and Mouille Point, flanked by the Atlantic Ocean, and then back towards the stadium. Formula E is, at its core, a street-racing affair. It has used existing circuits, such as the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez in Mexico City, but the championship’s goal is to bring racing into the heart of cities around the world, giving fans the opportunity to be up close and personal to the action. Racing in the streets of the Mother City will mean disruption to traffic and the lives of residents, with some full road closures lasting from 24 to 26 February. “The consultation process around the impact of the Formula E event started in 2021 with meetings between ratepayer associations and event organisers,” councillor Nicola Jowell told Daily Maverick. “The residential properties mainly affected in terms of access to their homes are on Beach and Bay [roads] after the intersection with Surrey Place. All residents are being issued with access permits which will enable them to access the street (where possible) and their building or designated parking place.” Residences on the track have been provided with alternative parking, and Bay Road residents can access their properties through a purpose-built entrance on the nearby golf course at the Hellenic Club. In Granger Bay, residents will have dedicated parking pre-arranged at the Oceana Club and will be able to access their homes through the coastal walkway. The 2.94km circuit through the streets of Green Point and Granger Bay around the iconic DHL Stadium is one of the fastest on the calendar.

Jowell said the event would be monitored by private security, that there would be “an extensive presence of additional safety and security services around the precinct” and that “there is no possibility of people [or animals] wandering onto the track”. “This is a very exciting event for the City of Cape Town and our events precinct, which is becoming one of the busiest in the world. Certainly in Africa. “The event organisers have shown a commitment to working with the community. No doubt there will be many learnings to come out of this event which will enhance the event for next year and hopefully aid in limiting the impact on the broader community,”  Jowell said. Formula E is an all-electric, single-seater world championship in which 11 teams with two drivers each compete in races across the world. Like other series, such as Formula 1, drivers compete to be world champion, while collecting as many points as possible for their teams’ bids for the constructor title. Last year’s champion was Stoffel Vandoorne of Mercedes-EQ. The year before, teammate Nyck de Vries won – and has since earned a Formula 1 seat with Alpha Tauri. The series is in its ninth season, having run since 2014 through 10 cities and 11 races. This year, 11 cities are on the roster, with 16 rounds wrapping up in London in July. What sets Formula E apart from other series is the power. Gen3 cars, the latest Formula 3 vehicles that debuted this year, are fitted with batteries to drive electric motors, delivering around 350kW of power. This adds a different strategy element to the racing. Formula E does not have pit stops for tyre replacements – the cars run on the same set throughout a race – so strategising about when to pit, what tyre to put on and making them last until the end is not as important as it is Formula 1. Rather, teams must manage their energy reserves and drivers must think strategically about when to push for an attack and use more power and when to conserve and regenerate their power. This adds an exciting element to the races, as drivers strive to find a perfect balance. South African Formula E reserve driver Kelvin van der Linde says Capetonians will get front-row seats as these strategies unfold. He adds that the Cape Town e-Prix course is thought to be one of the fastest on the calendar. “[It’s going to be] very, very fast, which means energy management is going to be critical because the longer you’re flat out, the more energy you need to recover. That naturally makes the racing better as well, because the more energy management is involved, the more strategy is involved. It’s really set up for a spectacle,” says Van der Linde.

I like the trajectory that Formula E is taking to go to new countries and grow the fanbase,” the double world champion noted. “I’ve been to Cape Town once before and I have very good memories from the city; I’m happy to go back,” he told Daily Maverick. Powered by electricity, Formula E is taking a new approach to racing, presenting an alternative to traditional fuels. The batteries powering the cars are charged by biofuels, the tyres are made with 28% sustainable materials and the entire event has been certified as net-zero. “Personally, I was initially not a big fan of racing electric vehicles, because I’m a petrolhead, right? But unfortunately, that is the way that our society is going to have to go in order to save our planet,” racing driver and motorsport presenter Naomi Schiff told South African media. “And, of course, there’s still a lot of things that need to be developed, and technology continues to evolve, but Formula E has done a really good job –  the Gen3 cars are spectacular,” she says. “I remember in season one, they were having to have pit stops to change cars, because the battery wouldn’t last the race distance, whereas now they’re racing 45 minutes, with cars that can do up to 300kmh. So it’s great to see them pushing the limits of this technology.” DM168 <img data-lazy-fallback="1" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1569429" src="https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Drivers.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="841" srcset="https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Drivers.jpg 3025w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Drivers.jpg?resize=411,480 411w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Drivers.jpg?resize=768,897 768w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Drivers.jpg?resize=720,841 720w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Drivers.jpg?resize=1314,1536 1314w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Drivers.jpg?resize=1753,2048 1753w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Drivers.jpg?resize=1280,1496 1280w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Drivers.jpg?resize=1600,1870 1600w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Drivers.jpg?resize=600,701 600w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px"  /> Nico Müller: The experienced driver is back in Formula E after a two-year spell in DTM, joining ABT on the German team’s comeback to the championship for Gen3.
