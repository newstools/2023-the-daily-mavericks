Insecurity is a big issue for voters in a country where armed gangs terrorise people in villages and on highways and carry out kidnappings for ransom. Police in Benue state responded to a distress call after gunmen blocked the Markudi-Naka road, forcing travellers to flee, Benue state police spokesperson Anene Sewuese Catherine said. The divisional police officer for Naka town, Mamud Abubakar, led a team of officers that engaged the armed gang in a gun fight, Catherine said in a statement. “However, the DPO [divisional police officer] who led the team sustained gunshot injuries and was rushed to General Hospital Naka where he was eventually confirmed dead,” Catherine said. A police source said two other police officers were shot and killed during the fight with the armed gang. When the gunmen retreated, they killed two children and three women in a nearby village, said the source, who declined to be named because he is not authorised to speak to the media.
