Monday, 13 February, is World Radio Day. For the 2023 observance, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (Unesco) highlights the importance of independent radio as a pillar for conflict prevention and peacebuilding. “In reporting and informing the general public, radio stations shape public opinion and frame a narrative that can influence domestic and international situations and decision-making processes,” according to the United Nations (UN) information page on the event. “Increasing radio’s journalistic standards and capacity should be considered as an investment in peace.” <img data-lazy-fallback="1" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1563763" src="https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/MC-CSW-13Feb-01.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="720" srcset="https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/MC-CSW-13Feb-01.jpg 1080w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/MC-CSW-13Feb-01.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/MC-CSW-13Feb-01.jpg?resize=480,480 480w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/MC-CSW-13Feb-01.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/MC-CSW-13Feb-01.jpg?resize=720,720 720w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/MC-CSW-13Feb-01.jpg?resize=100,100 100w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/MC-CSW-13Feb-01.jpg?resize=250,250 250w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/MC-CSW-13Feb-01.jpg?resize=350,350 350w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px"  /> Monday is the second day of Teen Suicide Prevention Week, which runs from 12 to 19 February this year. The observance takes place in South Africa annually and is an opportunity to focus on adolescent and youth mental health, as well as raise awareness around teen depression and suicide. In South Africa, 9% of all teenage deaths are due to suicide, according to a Western Cape government press release from May 2022. This number is increasing. “There’s currently a global increase in teenage depression, anxiety and suicide. Caregivers of adolescents must be aware of what to look out for and where to get help,” according to the release. “All threats or attempts to commit suicide should be taken seriously. In 75% of all suicides, the person gave some warning or made their intention known to a loved one.” Some ways in which you can help someone who is suicidal include: Those needing help can contact the South African Depression and Anxiety Group (Sadag) suicide crisis helpline on 080 056 7567. More resources on teen suicide prevention can be found here. On Monday, 13 February, at 9pm, Stop the War Coalition is hosting an online international rally to make the call for peace in Ukraine. “As part of our campaigning ahead of the one-year anniversary of the war in Ukraine, we are hosting an Online International Rally for Peace,” according to the event description. “Ever since Russia invaded Ukraine almost 12 months ago, [the Stop the War Coalition] have been making the case that the only real solution to the war lies in a ceasefire and a negotiated settlement.” Speakers at the rally will include Tariq Ali, writer and activist; Clare Daly, member of the European Parliament; Rafaella Bolini of the Associazione Ricreativa e Culturale Italiana; Lindsey German of Stop the War; and Kate Hudson of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament.

South Africa is facing a strained fiscus, rolling blackouts, austerity measures and hollowed-out institutions. The effects of state capture are immense. “State Capture has left very few aspects of public life untouched, from public rail to education, the health sector, defence industry, freight rail, law enforcement and our state revenue services,” according to the event description. “The social damage caused by State Capture should give urgency to our demand for accountability. We must do more to hold the powerful to account for the damage they have done.” Open Secrets’ Zen Mathe will be in conversation with Moira Campbell of Corruption Watch and Devi Pillay of the Public Affairs Research Institute. The speakers will be exploring how South Africans can address the social costs of state captures and seek restitution for the damage caused.
