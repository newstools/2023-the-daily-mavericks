Officials did not give details on the number of tanks delivered to Kyiv at this stage, but Poland has earlier pledged that a company of Leopard tanks would be handed to Ukraine as part of coalition building. “The prime minister couldn’t be here, he went to Kyiv to bring Leopard tanks which are the first batch delivered to Ukraine,” President Andrzej Duda said in his opening remarks at the meeting in Warsaw. Defence Minister Mariusz Blaszczak later said the tanks have already reached Ukraine. Warsaw’s commitment has been instrumental in convincing European allies to donate heavy gear to Ukraine, including tanks, a move opposed by several capitals, including Berlin, until recently. The first delivery comes less than a month after Polandsaid it aimed to get training time on Leopard 2 tanks down to five weeks for Ukrainian soldiers.
