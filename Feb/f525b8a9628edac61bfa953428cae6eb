With the evolution of smartphones over the years, users have started to pay more attention to the look and feel of the phones they carry. Even with the best technologies, users want their phones to look good in their hands. Representing a major step forward in smartphone aesthetics, the new HUAWEI Mate50 Pro features the symmetrical Space Ring Design and an eye-catching Clous de Paris step-patterned embossing design, which creates an intricate texture. The HUAWEI Mate50 Pro conveys the inclusive technological futurism of our current era. Equipped with industry-leading technology, the series wraps everything within a thin body offering a sleek and seamless look to all its users. Symmetry is said to be key in design as it provides a balanced and neat look. However, it can be difficult to achieve perfect symmetry when it comes to smartphones, as they also need to be able to pack in all essential hardware. On this front, the HUAWEI Mate50 Pro has once again broken new ground in smartphone design. Based on an iconic symmetry and Space Ring design, the phone’s streamlined camera modules keep the phone light without compromising imaging quality. Looking to add a touch of elegance to the slim body of the HUAWEI Mate50 Pro, the design teams at HUAWEI reproduced the Clous de Paris design onto its body. As a time-honoured embossing process that originated in France, this design pattern was previously found on luxurious wristwatches, jewellery and other accessories. The multi-layered camera module of the HUAWEI Mate50 Pro consists of lenses, decorative rings and a bottom crater. These components are meticulously processed on a whole piece of aluminium alloy material through computer numerical control (CNC) and fine engravings. This allows the series to maintain an intact cohesive structure and avoid scratching the surrounding components. <img data-lazy-fallback="1" class="aligncenter wp-image-1556851 size-full" src="https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/HUAWEI-Mate50-Pro-Black.jpg" alt="" width="6240" height="4160" srcset="https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/HUAWEI-Mate50-Pro-Black.jpg 6240w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/HUAWEI-Mate50-Pro-Black.jpg?resize=480,320 480w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/HUAWEI-Mate50-Pro-Black.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/HUAWEI-Mate50-Pro-Black.jpg?resize=720,480 720w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/HUAWEI-Mate50-Pro-Black.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/HUAWEI-Mate50-Pro-Black.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/HUAWEI-Mate50-Pro-Black.jpg?resize=1280,853 1280w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/HUAWEI-Mate50-Pro-Black.jpg?resize=1600,1067 1600w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/HUAWEI-Mate50-Pro-Black.jpg?resize=350,233 350w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px"  /> The HUAWEI Mate50 Pro features beautiful natural colourways that will suit the look and vibe of daily life.
