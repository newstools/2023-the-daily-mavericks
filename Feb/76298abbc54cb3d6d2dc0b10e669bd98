A by-election in Cape Town on Wednesday, 8 February, will be marked by the absence of South Africa‚Äôs two biggest parties. The ward, in the¬† Kensington/Maitland/Windermere area of the metropole, was left vacant following ward councillor Helen Jacobs‚Äô resignation at the end of 2022. Previously held by the Democratic Alliance (DA) with 53.91% of the votes received in the 2021 local government elections, the ward will be one of two contested countrywide this week. The by-election will stand out as having neither a DA nor an African National Congress (ANC) candidate. The DA failed to register a candidate in time, reported News24. The ANC‚Äôs provincial head of elections, Cameron Dugmore, told Daily Maverick on Monday that the party ‚Äúexperienced a problem with our internal candidate selection process‚Ä¶ and in the end, we did not register a candidate‚Äù. The by-election will be contested by the Good party, Patriotic Alliance (PA), Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), Al Jama-ah, Pan Africanist Congress of Azania, the African Christian Democratic Party and its breakaway party, the Africa Restoration Alliance (ARA). Visit Daily Maverick‚Äôs home page for more news, analysis and investigations Election analyst Wayne Sussman told Daily Maverick that whichever party wins the by-election could claim they were the ‚Äúbest-placed alternative to the DA in Cape Town and DA in 2024‚Äù. Candidates include the PA‚Äôs Cheslyn Steenberg, who was a member of the Kensington Community Policing Forum. Party president and Central Karoo District Municipality Mayor Gayton McKenzie lent his support to the PA‚Äôs candidate, with door-to-door visits in the area. Kevin Inglis, who stood as an independent candidate for the ward in the 2021 local government election and gained 10% of the votes, will return to the ballot as a candidate for the Good party. ‚ÄúWe hope that voters will elect our Good candidate, Kevin Inglis, who is the perfect Good candidate: an activist at heart who has served the community in voluntary roles for years,‚Äù said Good‚Äòs secretary-general, Brett Herron, on Monday. In the lead-up to the by-election, Good party leader Patricia de Lille has been with Inglis on walkabouts in the area. üó≥ Aunty Pat campaigning with our Cape Town Ward 56 by-election candidate ‚Äì Kevin Inglis.

The by-election has not been without drama; News24 reported the Good party had reported the ARA to the Electoral Commission, claiming the ARA had promised to paint people‚Äôs homes if they voted for the party. The other by-election will take place in Dikgatlong municipality in the Northern Cape, and will be contested by the DA, ANC and PA. DM
