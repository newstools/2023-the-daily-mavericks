“A bullet hasn’t got a name or an address,” says Allan Rehbok, founder of the Healing Waters Community organisation. In this short film, Capetonians tell of their paths of revenge after the senseless murder of their children or loved ones. The participants discuss how gangsterism, the Numbers gangs, drugs, illegal guns and police corruption weave a web of crime on the Cape Flats. They also share how they now strive for positive change through local organisations such as the Healing Waters Community and Manenberg Safety Forum. Also, meet the man who calls himself a “mix masala”, and his story of being adopted and changing his “race” status when he had to go to prison.
