Four new ANC MPs have been sworn in, suggesting there will be no fresh blood, and he is unlikely to use his authority to draft in two Cabinet ministers from outside Parliament. The President could make the Cabinet changes at the weekend. This is how the four new MPs can be used in a lightly reshaped Cabinet: Tau is a specialist in local government, which is falling apart despite Co-operative Government Minister Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma’s district development model. This model, which has been painted as the panacea for the sphere, is costing the ANC support because it is where state failure is first made manifest. <img data-lazy-fallback="1" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1555602" src="https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/good-cabinet-characteristics.jpg" alt="ramaphosa reshuffle" width="720" height="748" srcset="https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/good-cabinet-characteristics.jpg 1000w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/good-cabinet-characteristics.jpg?resize=462,480 462w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/good-cabinet-characteristics.jpg?resize=768,798 768w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/good-cabinet-characteristics.jpg?resize=720,748 720w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/good-cabinet-characteristics.jpg?resize=350,364 350w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px"  /> Dlamini Zuma is likely to stay in Cabinet despite facing disciplinary action from the ANC for voting against the party line about the Phala Phala report commissioned by Parliament in October 2022. This is the ongoing investigation into monies stolen from Ramaphosa’s game farm and kept secret from the public until exposed by former spymaster Arthur Fraser. This week, the same person told Daily Maverick, “Government performance is not only about Ministers.” He said programmes in the Presidency were still the key to solving the polycrises facing South Africa. “You have to take a holistic look rather than pinning everything on the Cabinet. People are hugely excited, but you have to ensure the stability of government.” This means you shouldn’t hold your breath for sweeping changes to the Cabinet, although Ramaphosa could use the 36 deputy minister positions to make further changes to the executive. <img data-lazy-fallback="1" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1555603 size-full" src="https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Super-presidency.jpg" alt="ramaphosa reshuffle presidency" width="720" height="2604" srcset="https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Super-presidency.jpg 1000w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Super-presidency.jpg?resize=133,480 133w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Super-presidency.jpg?resize=768,2777 768w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Super-presidency.jpg?resize=425,1536 425w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Super-presidency.jpg?resize=566,2048 566w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Super-presidency.jpg?resize=350,1266 350w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px"  /> The super Presidency If you want to know where power lies and see the Cabinet Ramaphosa would choose to be free of the shackles of a party-led political system, then look at this super Presidency. Since 2017, Ramaphosa has built a “Cabinet within a Cabinet” system. This “kitchen cabinet” is younger, technocratic and savvy, more global and pragmatic than the Cabinet that runs the country. ANC politics determines who is in the formal structure, and its composition must pay homage to all the power blocs in the ANC: provinces, factions, leagues and various histories of the governing party. The super Presidency runs vital arteries of government. The State Security Agency (the entire intelligence system) operates out of the Presidency under the authority of Mondli Gungubele, the Minister in the Presidency. Ramaphosa’s eight advisers served the roles of ministers in a high-functioning Cabinet. (Political adviser Bejani Chauke is out in the cold because of his proximity to the Phala Phala scandal, but the other advisers are still crucial.) All essential government programmes and crisis responses are run out of the Presidency. The Energy Action Plan, a response to the current and worsening power crisis, is run by Rudi Dicks. In a briefing last week, Dicks said he called Cabinet ministers and other officials every day to check where processes to unblock new power projects were. The Vulindlela programme is a heralded team that frees growth hurdles that stand in the way of the Economic Recovery Action Plan. The Presidential Youth Employment Stimulus plan is also in  Ramaphosa’s wing in the Union Buildings. At 2.9 million funded work opportunities, it is one of the world’s biggest public works schemes. The Presidency is a government within a government. While its intentions may be good, and the people who run it are young and talented with stripes in business, trade unions and government, it has become too big with too many structures and meetings to be effective. Take Nkosi’s job. When he started, his brief was simple: identifying where  bureaucratic red tape was holding up growth. Then a Red Tape Reduction Council cropped up, the opposite of the intuitive step to cut bureaucracy. Ramaphosa’s style is throwing structures at problems to negotiate solutions painstakingly, instead of simply executing. It’s a method trusted by the President, and even with a power crisis now four times worse than it was in 2021 and growth estimates revised down to 0.1% by the SA Reserve Bank, the love affair with structures to tackle our problems will continue. Expect a slight reshuffle and a more significant Presidency. DM
