In this 15-minute documentary, Jimmy, Ambrose, Xoliswa, Chantel, Babes, and Yvonne discuss the Blue Crane Route Municipality’s (BCRM) failure to maintain the power lines, and how they struggle to survive. At a community-organised march, town residents and farmers delivered a petition and suggested solutions to BCRM. The participants’ stories are that of disaster, and they have little hope that their so far peaceful cries for help will be heard.  The film was produced by Street Talk TV, a ground-breaking television and film series aired weekly on community television and on YouTube. In 15-minute films we capture and expose the lived realities and uncensored views of people living in South Africa. <img data-lazy-fallback="1" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-413805" src="https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/Street-Talk-Logo-1.jpg" alt="Street Talk Logo" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/Street-Talk-Logo-1.jpg 640w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/Street-Talk-Logo-1.jpg?resize=480,360 480w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/Street-Talk-Logo-1.jpg?resize=600,450 600w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"  /> Street Talk TV, a non-profit organisation, was launched in 2008.
