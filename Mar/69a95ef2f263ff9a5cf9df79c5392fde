The outgoing transport minister, Fikile Mbalula, said his replacement, Sindisiwe Chikunga, had “been given a chance” after many years. Chikunga was appointed as the new transport minister by President Cyril Ramaphosa during a Cabinet reshuffle on Monday night. Mbalula told journalists after the reshuffle that Chikunga had been around for a long time within her political party as well as in government. Chikunga had been deputy minister for transport twice since 2012. She was made deputy minister on 26 May 2014. Between 30 April 2019 and 5 August 2021, she was deputy minister of public service and administration. On 5 August 2021, she again became deputy minister of transport — until Monday’s reshuffle.
