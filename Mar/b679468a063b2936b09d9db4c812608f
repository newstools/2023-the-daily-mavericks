Apart from stopping in Cape Town on 10 December for six days, the Fedorov has been at sea for nearly four months, sailing under the flag of the Russian Antarctic Expedition (RAE). In coming weeks, the Fedorov’s RAE sister vessels are also set to replenish in port: the Akademik Tryoshnikov, another research vessel, will call at Table Bay on 26 March en route to Antarctica; and the Akademik Alexander Karpinsky, a seismic survey vessel that has amassed vast oil and gas inventories of the Southern Ocean seabed, is expected back in Cape Town after plying Antarctica’s protected waters.

The Jolly Roger, a familiar tourist ‘pirate’ ship at the V&A Waterfront, trundled onto the scene at the same time, heaving with tourists.

Preoccupied by two weekend events taking place around the Waterfront — a Stormers vs Sharks rugby match and the Cape Town Pride Parade — onlookers did not exactly line up to greet this worn lady of Antarctic seas. There was no evidence to suggest these kelp gulls knew what to make of the Fedorov’s arrival, either.

This year, the ice-strengthened ship serviced not only Russia’s five polar research stations, she also conducted her usual weather, oceanography and other Southern Ocean studies. But as envoys of a state waging an illegal, brutal war on Ukraine – also a treaty signatory that uses this port – Russia’s Antarctic fleet remains deeply controversial: a fired-up coalition of 29 South African organisations has vowed not to let the Karpinsky off the hook for seismic blasting that resembles prospecting. The Fedorov finally moored in the container dock on Saturday at about 5pm. It is unclear how long she will stay. (Photo: Nic Bothma). DM/OBP
