Muruna Makwarela has resigned as the mayor of Tshwane, the Congress of the People (COPE) confirmed on Friday, 10 March. The party’s Tshwane region said this was due to “questions raised over the legitimacy of his rehabilitation certificate or court order”. Makwarela was also withdrawn as a Cope councillor, and a replacement will be announced in due course, said the party in a statement released on Friday afternoon. Makwarela, the sole councillor for Cope in the Tshwane council, was elected mayor on 28 February in a dramatic sitting.

This meant he was removed as mayor. Then by Thursday, 9 March, Makwarela produced a certificate that showed that he was rehabilitated. “The City Manager of Tshwane, Mr Johann Mettler, received a notice of insolvency rehabilitation from Councillor Dr Murunwa Makwarela and has subsequently informed the Gauteng Provincial Electoral Officer of the [Electoral Commission of South Africa] to immediately withdraw the declaration of a vacancy for the Congress of the People (Cope) Proportional Representative Councillor,” read a statement issued by the City.

Cope’s statement called the matter “sub judice” and said they would not comment further. “The Cope Tshwane Region has therefore resolved to give Dr Murunwa Makwarela the space required to deal with these personal matters and legal matters and to afford him his constitutional right of being innocent until proven otherwise,” said the party.

Dr Makwarela’s integrity and questionable legitimacy as a duly elected City councillor have been at the nexus of these unfortunate events.” The coalition said the charges against Makwarela were “necessary in defence of the integrity of the Tshwane City Council”. Daily Maverick reached out to Makwarela on Friday afternoon for comment, but he did not respond to calls. DM
