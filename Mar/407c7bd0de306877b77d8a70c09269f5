Tuesday, 14 March is the first day of Anti-Racism Week, which runs until 21 March. Anti-Racism Week is an annual action week aimed at creating public awareness about racism, and how it affects individuals and broader society, according to the Anti-Racism Network South Africa.

On Tuesday at 3pm, BroadReach is hosting a webinar titled: “Lead with Localisation”, exploring the need to complement international funding of public health initiatives with implementation by local talent and on-the-ground insights. “International donors who play a major role in enabling African countries to achieve health equity and an end to Aids by 2030 are currently placing top priority on localisation as an approach to their public health partnerships on the continent. [The United States Agency for International Development], for instance, recently set policies and targets to increase funding to local non-governmental organisations by 25% by end 2024, to better achieve inclusive and locally-led development,” says the event description. “Conditions have changed in lower-income countries and the old idea that there is a lack of local talent and expertise is not true… so it makes sense to invest more in local education, technical training and infrastructure.” Speakers at the event include Dr Denis Mali, senior care and support advisor at USAID; Dhirisha Naidoo, Chief of Party for the Accelerating Program Achievements to Control the Epidemic (APACE) programme at BroadReach; Walusiku-Mwewa, country director for the Catholic Medical Mission Board in Zambia; Mpolokeng Mohloai, country director for Mothers 2 Mothers in Lesotho; and Amita Mehrotra, senior technical advisor for capacity development at nonprofit FHI360.

The seminar will explore the question: “Facing the climate crisis in a world of inequality: Who should pay? Who will pay?” Tooze sees climate change as the next big threat to global stability and believes that “it is not the development aspirations of the global poor that are driving the climate crisis, but the relentless increase in the already excessive consumption of the more affluent half of the world’s population and particularly that of the top 10% and top 1%,” says the event description.

Islamophobia is a fear of and prejudice towards Muslims that leads to intolerance by means of harassment, abuse and intimidation of Muslims and non-Muslims, both in the online and offline world. “Motivated by institutional, ideological, political and religious hostility that transcends into structural and cultural racism, it targets the symbols and markers of being a Muslim,” according to the United Nations information page on the event. “Many governments have taken steps to combat Islamophobia by establishing anti-hate-crime legislation and measures to prevent and prosecute hate crimes, and by conducting public awareness campaigns about Muslims and Islam designed to dispel negative myths and misconceptions.” On Wednesday, 15 March at 1pm, Daily Maverick is hosting a “pro-hope live journalism webinar”, titled “The Trailblazers: In conversation with Dr Imtiaz Sooliman”.
