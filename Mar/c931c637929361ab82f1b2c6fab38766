President Cyril Ramaphosa has further expanded capacity in his office by not only appointing a Minister of Electricity but also a minister who will be responsible for planning, monitoring and evaluation. “While this will result in an increase in the number of ministries in the short term, as indicated in the State of the Nation Address, I have instructed the Presidency and National Treasury to develop a proposal to rationalise government departments, entities and programmes to ensure greater efficiency. This work, which will result in the reduction of the number of ministries, will inform the configuration of the government going into the next administration,” the President explained. The head of the Investment and Infrastructure unit in the Presidency Kgosientsho Ramokgopa, has been announced as the first-ever electricity minister, a role which Ramaphosa dubbed as “transitory”. The President will have to transfer some powers and functions in terms of section 97 of the Constitution. “The recently published disaster regulations empower the Minister of Electricity to issue directions to, among others, exclude critical facilities from load shedding where technically feasible, expedite various regulatory processes for energy projects; and enable Eskom to undertake critical maintenance more quickly and efficiently. <img data-lazy-fallback="1" class="wp-image-1596951 size-full" src="https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/cabinet-reshuffle-march2023.jpg" alt="The new Cabinet announce by President Cyril Ramaphosa on 6 March 2022" width="1000" height="3270" srcset="https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/cabinet-reshuffle-march2023.jpg 1000w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/cabinet-reshuffle-march2023.jpg?resize=147,480 147w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/cabinet-reshuffle-march2023.jpg?resize=768,2511 768w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/cabinet-reshuffle-march2023.jpg?resize=306,1000 306w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/cabinet-reshuffle-march2023.jpg?resize=470,1536 470w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/cabinet-reshuffle-march2023.jpg?resize=626,2048 626w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/cabinet-reshuffle-march2023.jpg?resize=600,1962 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"  /> Visit Daily Maverick’s home page for more news, analysis and investigations “The primary task of the new minister will be to significantly reduce the severity and frequency of load shedding as a matter of urgency.

He has faced much criticism for taking his time in announcing his reconfigured Cabinet; however, Ramaphosa explained that processes needed to be followed to fulfil Constitutional requirements. “The changes that I am announcing now are intended to fill vacancies that have occurred in the executive and to direct government more effectively towards the areas that require urgent and decisive action. “I have sought to balance the need for new skills and capabilities to drive the agenda that we outlined in the State of the Nation Address with the important task of ensuring stability and continuity in the work of government. In the course of attending to current challenges, we are establishing two new ministries,” he said. The last time Ramaphosa reshuffled his Cabinet was in August 2021 after the July unrest that left more than 350 dead. The reshuffle included the appointment of 10 new ministers and 11 deputy ministers. DM
