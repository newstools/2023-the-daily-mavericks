Lily May Humphreys from England sealed an emotional maiden Sunshine Ladies and Ladies European Tour (LET) victory with a masterful two-shot triumph in the €300,000 Joburg Ladies Open on Saturday. The Englishwoman started the day six shots behind overnight leader Moa Folke, who overtook her in the final round of the Dimension Data Ladies Pro-Am to win at Fancourt three weeks ago.

I’m pretty speechless. I was so nervous playing 18. I just can’t believe I’ve done it. I’m really overwhelmed right now.” Humphreys believes a well-executed game plan produced the winning result.

I didn’t hole absolutely everything. “I started off holing two good putts on one and two and then on 14 and 16, and those luckily got me into the lead. I just tried to keep playing my game, which is fairways and greens and see what happens with the putts.” Moa Folke of Sweden was unable to defend her lead during the final round of the Joburg Ladies Open.

I didn’t know that I had a two-shot lead until I was putting on 18. The nerves properly kicked in then.” The hardest was waiting for the last two groups to finish. Folke, who failed to make up a deficit, signed for 74 and had to settle for a share of second on 10-under with Spain’s Ana Pelàez Trivino, who returned a 69. Kiera Floyd was the top South African finisher after the 18-year-old rookie closed with a two-under 71 to finish joint fourth with Czech golfer Klara Davidson Spilkova and 36-hole leader Nicole Broch Estrup from Denmark, who posted respective rounds of 73 and 74. Coming off a stellar amateur career, Humphreys had to delay turning professional for a year owing to the Covid pandemic. Now, 15 months into the pro ranks, she owns a Ladies European Tour winner’s category for the rest of the season, and the 2024 and 2025 seasons. More importantly, she has gained the confidence that she can compete – and beat – the best. “I came out to play on the Sunshine Ladies Tour to warm up, and to see where my game was at and to build some confidence. It’s worked so far,” the 20-year-old Chelmsford golfer said. “I love it here; I have been enjoying it and I have loved playing the Sunshine Ladies Tour. I’m in better form now and feel confident and I was happy that I was in the final few groups, and I started off nicely. I just wanted to be near contention at the start of the day. To be where I am now is incredible.” The victory bumped Humphreys to the top of the 2023 Investec Order of Merit, with Folke in second and Jabra Ladies Classic winner Casandra Alexander in third. The trio will duke it out in the money list race when the Sunshine Ladies Tour’s 10th season wraps up next week with the 30th Investec South African Women’s Open, also co-sanctioned by the Ladies European Tour. South Africa’s flagship event boasts an increased purse of €320,000 and will be hosted by the City of Cape Town from 8-11 March at Steenberg Golf Club for a second consecutive year.
