The newspaper, citing people familiar with the matter, said the call was likely to take place after Xi’s visit to Moscow next week. US national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Ukraine has not confirmed the call. * Moscow is suggesting to renew a deal allowing the safe export of grain from Ukraine’s Black Sea ports but only for a period of 60 days, half the term of the previous renewal, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Vershinin said on Monday after talks with UN officials in Geneva. * A patchwork of fixes and increased crop plantings around the world to counter the impact of war in Ukraine on global grain supplies are not enough to ward off further risks of disruption, experts say. * The situation in Bakhmut was difficult, the commander of Ukrainian ground forces said, though adding that his troops were repelling all Russian attempts to capture it. * The head of Russia’s Wagner mercenary group, which has led the assault on Bakhmut, said on Sunday the situation in the mining town was “tough, very tough … But we are advancing and we will be advancing”.
