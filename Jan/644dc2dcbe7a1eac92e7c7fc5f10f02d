It consists of 18 questions and should take no longer than 10 minutes of your time to complete. Your identity will never be revealed to anyone. We will only use this data to improve our services and to educate the public.” The survey is only for people 18 years and older, and can be accessed here. Those needing mental health support can contact Sadag on the Cipla mental health helpline on 0800 456 789; the SMS line on 31393; or the WhatsApp chat line on 076 882 2775. DM/MC
