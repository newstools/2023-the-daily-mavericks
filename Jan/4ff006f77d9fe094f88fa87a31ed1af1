This increase is above inflation, taking into account that for the [past] three years there has been no increase,” the minister stated. He also discussed Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) colleges, which focus on developing functional skills within a skilled trade for students. Allowances for TVET colleges are as follows: This briefing comes a week after Nzimande addressed the public about the department’s readiness for the 2023 academic year. In that briefing, on Tuesday, 23 January, Nzimande announced that universities must allow NSFAS students to register without paying registration fees upfront. NSFAS will pay these fees directly to the university on 6 February and students should not be barred from registering at any institution — as happened in previous years. Unsuccessful NSFAS applicants have a window to appeal against this decision by submitting relevant supporting documents between 20 January and 20 February. Nzimande said the government was committed to transforming the tertiary education system and ensuring students were not excluded from higher learning. “It is not an option for our post-school education and training system to remain the preserve of only those who can afford to pay. In a deeply unequal society like that of South Africa, something significant needed to be done,” he said. DM
