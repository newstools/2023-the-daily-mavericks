The Department of Public Works and Infrastructure (DPWI) in 2019 issued a tender to find a new head office for the Department of Health (DoH). The open tender process collapsed under questionable circumstances, paving the way for the appointment of the DoH’s new landlord through a “deviation” from standard procurement processes.

Thanks to the collapsed bid process and the subsequent tender deviation, Hiroworx could now receive up to R486.7-million for a seven-year lease.
