We have no idea how it got to Mdumbi.” He said the illegal dumping of hazardous waste posed a danger to the environment and to the health of humans who might become exposed to infection and toxins.

He said the World Health Organization estimated that about 15% of waste from healthcare activities is dangerous to humans and the environment. “This danger is very diverse. It is a bacterial threat, a chemical one, a radioactive one and an ecological one.” Read more in Daily Maverick: “Beaches at risk: Report reveals alarming pollution along Cape Town’s coast” Another resident, Lu Hemsley, said a lot of medical waste had washed up at Mngcibe Beach. “I don’t want the kids at the beach as they will be playing with the stuff… picking it up. I did let the ward councillor know about this on Sunday, the first time we found this.” Hemsley confirmed that some of the medical waste had been removed on Wednesday. Nyandeni Local Municipality said the matter had been brought to their attention through their social media page and they had escalated it to the Department of Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment. “We will continue to liaise with them to ensure that this matter is attended to as soon as possible,” said the municipality. Eastern Cape Department of Health spokesperson Yonela Dekeda said the matter was being urgently dealt with. “The medical waste has been removed. The department is currently investigating where the medical waste may have come from,” she said. DM/OBP
