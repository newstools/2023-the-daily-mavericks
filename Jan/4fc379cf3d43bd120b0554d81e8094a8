On Tuesday 24 January, the official nominations for the 2023 Oscars were announced by hosts Allison Williams (star and executive producer of M3GAN) and Riz Ahmed (nominated for best actor in 2021 for his role in Sound Of Metal and co-writer of The Long Goodbye, winner of Best Live Action Short Film in 2022). The Oscars themselves will be awarded on 12 March, hosted once again by Jimmy Kimmel.  The spectacular multiversal sci-fi, Everything Everywhere All at Once, is the deserving leader of the pack with 11 nominations, followed by the Irish dark comedy, The Banshees of Inisherin, and the Netflix World War 2 epic All Quiet on the Western Front, which both received nine nominations. For the most part, nominations went as expected, but the few surprises were pretty drastic upsets. The contenders for the most anticipated award at the ceremony this year is particularly dominated by big mainstream productions. The list includes both of the highest-grossing films for 2022: Avatar: The Way of Water and Top Gun: Maverick, which also makes 2023 the first time ever for two sequels in the running for Best Picture. The absence of their kindred spirit, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, opened the door for a few edgier candidates, including Triangle of Sadness, a scathing satire of the rich, and Women Talking, a drama based on a repressive religious Bolivian community. Janet Yang, President of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, opened the nomination ceremony by noting that “nominees in most categories are chosen by their peers – actors nominate actors, film editors vote for the best edited movies of the year… But the final and most anticipated award, Best Picture, is chosen by the entire academy membership – that’s around 10,000 filmmakers and artists living and working in over 80 countries.” It’s looking like your best bet to take it home is Everything Everywhere All at Once, not just because it received the most awards but because of its extremely wide appeal. Still, it’s anyone’s guess – The Banshees of Inisherin is a more typical winner in this category and has been very well received. And Hollywood does love its own reflection, so it would be disappointing (albeit not unexpected) if Spielberg’s autobiographical The Fabelmans came out on top. All Quiet on the Western Front

Women Talking  *** Best Director This year, the directors receiving recognition are exclusively men. The winners of this category in the past two years were both women: Jane Campion won in 2022 for The Power of the Dog, a lengthy Western about toxic masculinity, and Chloe Zhao won in 2021 for Nomadland, a character study about a woman traveling the US in a van. Still, it’s understandable that some are disappointed and maddened that Sarah Polley wasn’t included for Women Talking. Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert for Everything Everywhere All at Once
Martin McDonagh for The Banshees of Inisherin
Ruben Östlund for Triangle of Sadness
Steven Spielberg for The Fabelmans
Todd Field for Tár *** Academy favourite Brad Pitt’s performance in Babylon was overlooked for best actor, likely collateral damage of Damien Chazelle’s overzealous screenplay, and the result is that all five actors are first-time nominees. South Africans may notice that Bill Nighy’s nomination is for his performance in Living, (also nominated for best adapted screenplay) directed by the excellent Oliver Hermanus, who directed Moffie and Skoonheid.  A surprise nomination was Brendan Fraser, whose career as a leading man in action flicks was cut short by health issues. He has completely changed tact in his earnest performance as an estranged morbidly obese father trying to reconnect with his daughter in the A24 drama The Whale. Austin Butler in Elvis

Paul Mescal in Aftersun *** Probably the most surprising and happy inclusion of the nominations this year was that of Andrea Riseborough for her performance as a Texan alcoholic who wins the lottery in To Leslie, an indie film that flew largely under the radar. A group of A-list actors including Charlize Theron, Cate Blanchett, Edward Norton and Gwyneth Paltrow joined a social media push to get her the recognition she deserved.  Less surprising but still unexpected was Ana de Armas’s nomination for her role in the Marilyn Monroe Netflix biopic Blonde, which bombed, in large part due to its overindulgent length. De Armas apparently squeaked in due to international support – industry folk do tend to have a soft spot for nostalgic pop culture. The surprise nominations meant that there wasn’t room in the limelight for powerhouse actress Viola Davis, whose starring role in The Woman King was certainly worth some recognition.

Michelle Yeoh in Everything Everywhere All at Once *** Ke Huy Quan’s nomination for his role in Everything Everywhere All at Once, was assured pretty much as soon as the film was released, but just a couple years earlier it would have seemed impossible, even to him. Quan was a child actor most famous for his role as Short Round in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. Until Everything Everywhere All at Once, he was convinced that his career in film was over.

Many MCU films have been nominated in technical categories, and the first Black Panther film was nominated for Best Picture in 2019, but Bassett’s is the first nomination based on acting prowess.

Stephanie Hsu in Everything Everywhere All at Once *** All Quiet on the Western Front has done surprisingly well overall, particularly in the technical categories, and is the favourite of the international features. An unfortunate exclusion in this category is the phenomenal Danish crime-thriller, Holy Spider, directed by Ali Abbasi, about a fictional female journalist investigating a real serial killer who targeted sex workers.

The Quiet Girl (Ireland) *** Bardo, False Chronicle of a Handful of Truths was probably banking on being nominated for Best International Feature, but perceptions of the film as being over-indulgent and pretentious got in the way despite director Alejandro G. Iñárritu’s best efforts to preempt them. Luckily for him, Darius Khondji’s cinematography was utterly breathtaking from the first moments, putting the film in good stead to win in that category and save some face.

Tár for Florian Hoffmeister *** The Indian action drama RRR has developed a bit of a cult international following since its American debut, so it was probably a bit of a disappointment for director SS Rajamouli that it wasn’t selected as India’s official submission. Its only nomination has been for its vibey song, Naatu Naatu.  Applause from Tell It Like a Woman, Music and Lyric by Diane Warren
