The 9th ANC Free State elective conference marks the end of former party secretary-general Ace Magashule’s dominance in the province after his allies failed to dethrone supporters of President Cyril Ramaphosa. Despite his two-year suspension, Magashule had allies in the Interim Provincial Committee (IPC), including coordinator Paseka Nompondo who failed in his bid to become provincial secretary. The province elected its Top Five on Sunday, 22 January, after a conference marred by grievances, violence, protests and threats of litigation. The conference at the Imvelo Safari Lodge in Mangaung was attended by more than 800 delegates, 657 of whom were voting delegates. The provincial Top Five leaders elected this weekend are: The outcomes of the conference also reaffirm Ramaphosa’s grip on the control of the ANC countrywide.

On whether she would support the court bid, Ntombela replied: “Let me just hear what is happening. I want to hear from them on what exactly happened. I will discuss with them. My main thing is that we are not here for ourselves, but for the people.” Magashule appeared in the Bloemfontein High Court on Friday, 20 January — the same day the conference was scheduled to start. Speaking to journalists after his appearance, he claimed that processes leading up to the conference had been rigged and that those associated with him were guaranteed to lose.

Ntombela believes she fought a good fight as the position was seldom contested by women. “It is not an easy task for a woman to stand for the chairperson position, especially in the ANC, but I told myself that I would try. I knew it was going to be difficult.” Ramaphosa is expected to close the conference on Sunday evening. DM
